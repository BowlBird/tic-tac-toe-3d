# Tic-Tac-Toe-3D

This is a game based on the concept of Tic-Tac-Toe extended into 3D, with rules and game formatting following in the footsteps of the game *'Qubic'*.

This game uses the Godot game engine (specifically Godot 4) with rust integration thanks to the [rust-gdextension tool](https://github.com/godot-rust/gdextension).
